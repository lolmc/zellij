# zellij
All zellij instances should be using this config on all of my machines unless there are differences due to local hardware or variances in usage - this should be addressed by having a separate branch for those systems that differ from the main configuration.

Blackryzen fits into this category as there is an issue running btop which needs to be fixed before returning to base config.
